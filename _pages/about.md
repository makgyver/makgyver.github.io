Hi there! My name is Mirko Polato and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Turin (Italy).

I received my MSc and Ph.D. in [Brain, Mind, and Computer Science](http://hit.psy.unipd.it/BMCS-Overview) from the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/) (Italy) in 2013 and 2018, respectively. In 2017, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in the [Multimedia Computing group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/multimedia-computing/). From 2018 to 2021, I have spent three years as a post-doctoral fellow at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/).

Currently, I have published 50+ research articles on international conferences and journals. I served as a Program Committee member of several international conferences and as editor and referee for several international journals.

My main research interests include `federated learning`, `interpretable machine learning`, `recommender system`, and `representation learning`.
