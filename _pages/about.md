Hi there! My name is Mirko Polato and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Turin (Italy).

I received his MSc and Ph.D. in Brain, Mind, and Computer Science from the University of Padova (Italy) in 2013 and 2018, respectively. In 2017, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the Delft University of Technology in the Multimedia Computing group, under the supervision of Prof. Martha Larson. From 2018 to 2021, I have spent three years as a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Padova.

Currently, I have published 40+ research articles on international conferences and journals. I served as a Program Committee member of several international conferences and as a guest editor and referee for several international journals.

My main research interests include federated learning, interpretable machine learning, cybersecurity, recommender system, and representation learning.
