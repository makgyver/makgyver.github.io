During my carrier as a researcher, I have been working on several topics related to machine learning like:
- Federated Learning
- Explainable/Interpretable Machine Learning
- Cybersecurity
- Recommender Systems
- Kernel Methods
- Process Mining

In the last years, I am focusing my efforts on **Federated Learning** with several recent publications [[C19](/publications/#C19), [C20](/publications/#C20), [C21](/publications/#C21), [C25](/publications/#C25)]. 

I am also active in the organization of workshops on this theme:
- [1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies @ TheWebConf 2023](https://flw.di.unito.it)
- [1st Workshop on Advancement in Federated Learning @ ECML-PKDD 2023](https://2023.ecmlpkdd.org/)

as well as special sessions 
- [Special Session on Federated Learning Methods, Applications, Challenges, and beyond @ IJCNN 2023](https://federated-learning-ijcnn2023.github.io/)

and journal special issue:
- Federated Learning: Theoretical and Practical Advances - Frontiers in Big Data

Before diving into Federated Learning, in the past, I worked on **Cybersecurity** [[C12](/publications/#C12)] and security/privacy ascpects related to recommender systems [[C16](/publications/#C16),[J11](/publications/#J11)].
**Recommender Systems** have been a research topic of mine since my Ph.D. thesis [[C14](/publications/#C14), [W03](/publications/#W03), [C17](/publications/#C17), [W04](/publications/#W04), [C24](/publications/#C24)], and I am still relatively active in this area.

Another research area I am still interested in is **Interpretable Machine Learning**. I have been tackling this problem from different angles, e.g., via rule-set learning [[C12](/publications/#C12)], designing ad-hoc method based on game-theoretic concepts [[C13](/publications/#C13), [C15](/publications/#C15), [J12](/publications/#J12)], and using logic-based kernels [[C05](/publications/#C05), [C10](/publications/#C10), [J06](/publications/#J06)].

During my Ph.D., I specialized myself in the development of **logic-based kernels** for categorical data with applications to collaborative filtering [[C20](/publications/#C02), [C03](/publications/#C03), [W02](/publications/#W02), [J01](/publications/#J01), [J02](/publications/#J02)] and for the design of interpretable machine learning techniques [[C05](/publications/#C05), [C10](/publications/#C10), [J06](/publications/#J06)].
I also worked on theoretical aspects related to suc family kernels [[C04](/publications/#C04), [J03](/publications/#J03), [J10](/publications/#J10)].

However, my most cited works are related to **Process Mining** in particular machine learning applied to the
prediction of the remaining time of a running process instance [[C01](/publications/#C01), [C11](/publications/#C11), [J04](/publications/#J04)].
